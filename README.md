# Inventory-Management-System-for-a-Retail-Store


This project showcases an **Inventory Management System** built with SQL for a small retail store. The system enables efficient tracking of inventory, including item names, categories, expiry dates, stock quantities, supplier details, and reorder levels. It simulates a real-world application of SQL in managing inventory workflows and supporting decision-making in retail businesses.

# 📌 Features

- ✅ Custom database creation (`Inventory_Store`)
- ✅ Inventory table with 50+ realistic entries
- ✅ Tracks key attributes like:
  - Item name
  - Category
  - Quantity in stock
  - Expiry date
  - Supplier
  - Reorder level
- ✅ Basic queries to extract actionable insights (e.g., items low in stock, expired items)

# 📂 Project Structure
